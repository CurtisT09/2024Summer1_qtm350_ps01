## Sahithi Gangaram:
- **Project Title: Climate Guardian - Climate Change Mitigation**
- **Project Description:** This project focuses on monitoring and predicting climate changes using data from satellites, weather stations, and ocean buoys. It aims to create models to forecast extreme weather events and assess the impact of various mitigation strategies to combat climate change.
- **Objectives**
  1. **Data Collection:**
     - Gather real-time climate data from various sources including satellites, weather stations, and ocean buoys.
     - Integrate historical climate data to provide context and improve model accuracy.

  2. **Data Analysis:**
     - Analyze collected data to identify trends and patterns in climate change.
     - Utilize machine learning algorithms to process and interpret large datasets efficiently.

  3. **Prediction Models:**
     - Develop predictive models to forecast extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods.
     - Assess the accuracy and reliability of different predictive models and improve them based on feedback and new data.

  4. **Impact Assessment:**
     - Evaluate the potential impact of climate change on different regions and sectors, including agriculture, water resources, and human health.
     - Model the effectiveness of various climate change mitigation strategies.

  5. **Visualization:**
     - Create visualizations to present data and predictions in an accessible and understandable format.
     - Develop interactive dashboards for policymakers and the public to explore climate data and predictions.

  6. **Collaboration and Communication:**
     - Collaborate with climate scientists, data analysts, and policymakers to ensure the project's outputs are relevant and useful.
     - Regularly communicate findings and updates through reports, presentations, and an online platform.

  7. **Public Awareness:**
     - Increase public awareness of climate change issues by making data and visualizations available to the general public.
     - Develop educational materials and resources to help people understand the impact of climate change and the importance of mitigation efforts.

  8. **Scalability and Sustainability:**
     - Ensure that the project's methods and tools are scalable and can be applied to different regions and climates.
     - Plan for the long-term sustainability of the project by securing funding and building a robust, maintainable infrastructure.

  9. **Policy Recommendations:**
     - Provide data-driven recommendations for climate policy and action.
     - Support local, national, and international efforts to combat climate change with concrete data and insights.

  10. **Continuous Improvement:**
      - Continuously improve data collection, analysis methods, and predictive models based on new research and technological advancements.
      - Solicit feedback from stakeholders and users to enhance the project's relevance and impact.

Hurricanes:
1) NOAA keeps data on every major storm in the US from 1958 including information about the weather conditions and severity of the storm. This can be analyzed in order to identify any patterns leading to deadly hurricanes. The link is here: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/
2) NOAA also keeps data regarding the paths that tropical storms have taken from 1950-2020. This can be analyzed in conjunction with the dataset above in order to give more accurate early predictions of hurricane routes so residents have more time to evacuate. The link is here: https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/hurricane-tracks-cumulative/
3) The US Marine Corps has a hurricane decision making simulator in order to help train reserve troops and the public on how to make decisions during potentially uncertain huricane forcasting. This would be interesting to look through in order to forcast potentially policy and evacuation decisions that may occur along with a weather forcasting model.

Fires:
1) NASA keeps data similar to NOAA's hurricane data on wildfires in the US. This includes weather conditions before the fire along with the scale and severity of the fire. This will be useful to predict locations of future fires given certain weather patterns. The link is here: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/human-dimensions/natural-hazards/wildfires
2) The National Interagency Fire Center keeps records on the number of wilfires caused by different means such as human causes or natural causes (like lightning). Knowing the percentages of fires caused by different sources will be useful to predict the number and severity of future fires. The link is here: https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics
3) The NFPA has data regarding the deaths, cost, and land destroyed for different types of fires (home, car, wildfires). This will be useful to look and to be able to give a prediction of the human and capital loss that may come with different fires.
