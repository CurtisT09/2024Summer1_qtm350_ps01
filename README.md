- **Data Analysis**

Hurricanes:
1) NOAA keeps data on every major storm in the US from 1958 including information about the weather conditions and severity of the storm. This can be analyzed in order to identify any patterns leading to deadly hurricanes. The link is here: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/
2) NOAA also keeps data regarding the paths that tropical storms have taken from 1950-2020. This can be analyzed in conjunction with the dataset above in order to give more accurate early predictions of hurricane routes so residents have more time to evacuate. The link is here: https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/hurricane-tracks-cumulative/
3) The US Marine Corps has a hurricane decision making simulator in order to help train reserve troops and the public on how to make decisions during potentially uncertain huricane forcasting. This would be interesting to look through in order to forcast potentially policy and evacuation decisions that may occur along with a weather forcasting model. The link is here: https://hurricane.mfr.nps.edu/

Fires:
1) NASA keeps data similar to NOAA's hurricane data on wildfires in the US. This includes weather conditions before the fire along with the scale and severity of the fire. This will be useful to predict locations of future fires given certain weather patterns. The link is here: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/human-dimensions/natural-hazards/wildfires
2) The National Interagency Fire Center keeps records on the number of wilfires caused by different means such as human causes or natural causes (like lightning). Knowing the percentages of fires caused by different sources will be useful to predict the number and severity of future fires. The link is here: https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics
3) The NFPA has data regarding the deaths, cost, and land destroyed for different types of fires (home, car, wildfires). This will be useful to look and to be able to give a prediction of the human and capital loss that may come with different fires. The link is here: https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/fire-loss-in-the-united-states

Earthquakes:
1) The USGS contains informations about all significant earthquakes in the US and the world. This includes the location, magnitude, and time of the earthquake. This information will give the past history of earthquakes in the world. The link is here: https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/lists-maps-and-statistics
2) Our World in Data contains the data of deaths from earthquakes in the world from 1500-2023. Combining this data with information regarding the severity of the earthquakes will be useful in predicting the human toll from earthquakes. The link is here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/earthquake-deaths
3) USGS has a map of all fault lines in the US. This will be important to analyze in order to see where earthquakes could occur. The link is here:
